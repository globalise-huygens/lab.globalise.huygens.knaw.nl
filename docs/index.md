The aim of the [GLOBALISE project](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/) is to develop an online infrastructure that unlocks the key series of VOC documents and reports for advanced research methods. On this site, we share experiments and prototypes related to our datasets and infrastructure. We welcome [your feedback](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/contact-us/).

GLOBALISE is funded by the [The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)](https://www.nwo.nl/en).

### Experiments

- [Word Embeddings](experiments/GLOBALISE_Word2Vec_Lab.ipynb) trained on the c. 5 million pages of VOC transcriptions.
- [Viewer for transcriptions](experiments/htr-viewer.md) of the c. 5 million pages of VOC documents that comprise the GLOBALISE corpus.
- [Visualization of places](experiments/places-visualization.md) occurring in the c. 5 million pages of VOC documents that comprise the GLOBALISE corpus.
- [Search Interface for the General Missives of the VOC](experiments/blacklab-search-interface-general-missives.md), as edited and published in 14 book volumes over the period 1960-2017.
- [Text-Fabric Serialization of the General Missives of the VOC](experiments/text-fabric-general-missives.md), especially suited for computational analysis of this corpus.
