A Text-Fabric representation of the _General Missives_ of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) offers a new way to explore and analyze these reports. The _General Missives_ sent from Batavia (Jakarta) to the Dutch Republic between 1610 and 1795, are now accessible for in-depth research thanks to efforts within the [CLARIAH project](https://www.clariah.nl/) by a team from [VU University](https://vu.nl/), the [Huygens Institute](https://www.huygens.knaw.nl/), and the [Dutch Language Institute](https://ivdnt.org/). Utilizing advanced OCR and Named Entity Recognition techniques [^1], the team enhanced these documents with metadata and structural elements, including annotations for entities like persons and locations.

The Text-Fabric serialization of the enriched texts is especially suited for linguistic analysis with computational methods. Users can explore the materials in the [Text-Fabric search interface](https://clariah.github.io/wp6-missieven-search/text/index.html) or by using the [Text-Fabric Python package](https://github.com/CLARIAH/wp6-missieven/). A slightly less cleaned version of the same corpus is also available in a [BlackLab search environment](https://lab.globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/experiments/blacklab-search-interface-general-missives.md).

The _General Missives_ summarize the information contained in the _Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren_ series of documents from the VOC archives that the GLOBALISE project aimes to unlock for in-depth research. The corpus available in the BlackLab environment is a selection of General Missives from the period 1610-1767 that was transcribed, edited and published in 14 (digital) book volumes by the Huygens Institute and its predecessors. The original volumes are also [available online](https://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vocgeneralemissiven). 

Please note that the General Missives contain labels, characterizations and information about persons, actions and events that may be offensive and troubling to individuals and communities.
