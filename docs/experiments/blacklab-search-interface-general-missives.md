A BlackLab search environment offers a new way to explore the _General Missives_ of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). These reports, sent from Batavia (Jakarta) to the Dutch Republic between 1610 and 1795, are now accessible for in-depth research thanks to efforts within the [CLARIAH project](https://www.clariah.nl/) by a team from [VU University](https://vu.nl/), the [Huygens Institute](https://www.huygens.knaw.nl/), and the [Dutch Language Institute](https://ivdnt.org/). Utilizing advanced OCR and Named Entity Recognition techniques[^1], the team enhanced these documents with metadata and structural elements, including annotations for entities like persons and locations.

The BlackLab interface facilitates computational analysis and robust search capabilities of the enriched texts. Researchers can now perform complex syntactic searches or simple keyword queries, uncovering nuanced historical and linguistic insights. A slightly cleaner version of the same corpus is also available as a [Text-Fabric resource](https://lab.globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/experiments/text-fabric-general-missives).

The _General Missives_ summarize the information contained in the _Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren_ series of documents from the VOC archives that the GLOBALISE project aimes to unlock for in-depth research. The corpus available in the BlackLab environment is a selection of General Missives from the period 1610-1767 that was transcribed, edited and published in 14 (digital) book volumes by the Huygens Institute and its predecessors. The original volumes are also [available online](https://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vocgeneralemissiven). 

Please note that the General Missives contain labels, characterizations and information about persons, actions and events that may be offensive and troubling to individuals and communities.
